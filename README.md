# Libft

Libft is my first custom C library, built as part of the School42 curriculum. This project focuses on reimplementing essential C standard library functions as well as additional utility functions that will serve as a foundation for future projects. The goal is to enhance my understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and C functions.
